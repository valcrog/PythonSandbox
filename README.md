# Python Sandbox

Welcome to the Python Sandbox repository!

This repository is a collection of small Python projects that I have created for fun and to explore new topics. Each project is a standalone piece of code that demonstrates a specific concept, technique, or idea in Python programming.

Feel free to browse through the projects :)

## Projects

- Project 1 (v0.1): PoolBounce

## Projects description
### Project 1 - Pool Bounce Simulation
Ok, this one is a bit silly. We were playing pool when we wondered: would an infinite force allow us to make the ball reach a hole, no matter where or in which direction we hit it? I'm sure some math could help me figure it out, but spending too much time on such a simple Python project just sounded way more fun...

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valcrog/PythonSandbox.git
cd PythonSandbox/project-directory
```

Then, install the requirements using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You're now all set to run the main project file `main.py` !
